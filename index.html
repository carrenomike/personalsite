          <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
      <p>Mike believes in two things: discovery and connection. That discovery is one of life’s greatest joys and that happiness is only real when shared. He believes that as we endeavor, struggle, fail, and pick ourselves up to try again, we are discovering the Truth of life. And even as we fail to find it and even as we stumble upon it, we are helping humanity find that which we are all looking for. Whether you call it Oneness, God, Truth, Happiness, or some other name, they are one and they are the same.</p>
      <p>Through his travels, businesses, family, and friendships, Michael inspires and leads an expansive community of people who share his enthusiasm for life. Mike has affected great positive change in society through entrepreneurship and philanthropy, but those closest to him know him for his love, his loyalty, his infectious faith in the good, and his dogged pursuit for the Truth. We all know that wherever he is at a given moment, he is on a path of discovery and connection to find the Truth.</p>
