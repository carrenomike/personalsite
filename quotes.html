    <h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">Serenity Prayer</h3>
    <h4 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">by Reinhold Neibuhr</h4>
      <p style="margin-top:0;">God, grant me the serenity
        <br>To accept the things I cannot change,
        <br>Courage to change the things that I can,
        <br>And the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
        <br>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">Our Deepest Fear</h3>
    <h4 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">by Marianne Williamson</h4>
      <p style="margin-top:0;">Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
        <br>Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure
        <br>It is our light, not our darkness
        <br>That most frightens us.</p>
      <p>We ask ourselves
        <br>Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?
        <br>Actually, who are you not to be?
        <br>You are a child of God.</p>
      <p>Your playing small
        <br>Does not serve the world.
        <br>There's nothing enlightened about shrinking
        <br>So that other people won't feel insecure around you.</p>
      <p>We are all meant to shine,
        <br>As children do.
        <br>We were born to make manifest
        <br>The glory of God that is within us.</p>
      <p>It's not just in some of us;
        <br>It's in everyone</p>
      <p>And as we let our own light shine,
        <br>We unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
        <br>As we're liberated from our own fear,
        <br>Our presence automatically liberates others.</p>
